# BRIAR API Stubs

## gRPC Stubs Overview

Stubs are the 'compiled' versions of the protobuf files, although I use the word 'compiled' loosely because the protobuf files have actually been translated into the cooresponding language's source code. These files are significantly more complex than the protobuf files but the names of messages and services defined in the protobuf files remain the same in the source files and the objects are ready to use once you have included the source files into your project.


## Instructions on how to use gRPC stubs for compatable languages

Google has instructions on how to use gRPC for the different supported languages on their main gRPC website. The link below will take you to a page where you can select a tutorial for your language of choice.
